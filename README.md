# Cekopt
This is a simple app that when you log into it will sort your unread items by length (time to read).

## Usage
```js
npm install
KEY={{consumer_key}} node index.js
```

## Name
The name comes from ordering Pocket alphabetically:

```js
Array.prototype.slice.call('pocket').sort().join('')
```

Kindly suggested to me by [@ljharb](//github.com/ljharb).
